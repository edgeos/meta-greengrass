# Attempt to restart service once every RestartSec
# Restart "on-failure" (not "always"), because normal behavior seems to be that greengrassd 
# exits with 0 on sucess after creating a spin-off process and exit of original process.
# "always" restart keeps killing old spinn-off greengrass process.

# Allow a max of StartLimitBurst starts every StartLimitIntervalSec seconds.

# Exceeding this rate will also disallow manual starts until the StartLimitIntervalSec has passed.
# Setting StartLimitIntervalSec=0 disables rate limiting.
